 * I've found that I sometimes spend more time messing with build programs (such 
 * as Maven, Gradle, and others) than the underlying application I am trying to 
 * build.  They all do the normal things very, very easily.  But when you try to
 * go off their beaten path it gets real difficult real fast.  Being sick and
 * tired of this, and having easily built a shell script to build what I want, I
 * needed a more portable solution.  The files in this directory are that solution.
 *
 * It should be noted, however, that unlike a shell script, this build system 
 * does not execute commands that are already done.  In other words, only the 
 * minimum steps necessary to rebuild a system are actually executed.  So, this 
 * build system runs as fast as the others.
 *
 * There are two classes as follows:
 *
 *     BuildUtils -  the generic utilities needed to build
 *     Tasks      -  the application-specific build procedures (or tasks)
 *
 *    Non-private instance methods with no parameters are considered tasks.
